2024-09-24 22:10:49	seguesan	Madness brings the song to the UK: "Let's go 2 War with our buddy Unkie Sam!"
2024-09-24 22:10:53	Sora	All of this Pro-Ukraine non sense in the West is quite disturbing. Why do so many who have never been to the country, likely never showed any interest in it, suddenly care just because Russia attacked it?
2024-09-24 22:10:54	+space	if the us population is 280million, and you increase the inelastic supply my 1 percent, what would macroeconomics deem this effect to be? Keep in mind your SAT vocabulary term such as: "Inelastic Demand"!

2024-09-24 22:12:06	resident-	Russia got embarrassed and continues to get embarrassed.  One can acknowledge this without being in favor of war in that region, or indeed loving Ukraine.  Try to grasp this.
2024-09-24 22:12:10	Sora	Russia will keep their land and much of the rest will be taken by the West

2024-09-24 22:13:41	resident-	Now having said that, who wouldn't feel sympathy for the underdog.  For the invaded party.  For whom one has to engage in hilarious mental gymnastics to paint as an aggressor because to resist a second post-USSR invasion and annexation is tantamount to inviting western missiles into the heart of Moscow.

2024-09-24 22:22:19	resident-	Mocking Russia is not loving Ukraine.  Understanding the logistical limits of Biden's possible culpability in the Russia-Ukraine conflict is not the same as loving Biden, nor pretending he's about to win Quiz Bowl.

2024-09-25 03:33:03	seguesan	Also there's a hack where you can temporarily set the clock ahead and set it to remind you later, but that later is 5 years in the future.

2024-09-25 07:41:29	rkorandy	Jigsaw why do you want to be in the CIA
2024-09-25 07:41:44	+incog	and yes polygraphs are a meme but they are still used
2024-09-25 07:41:51	+agentmx_	you may attrct multiple parking fines

2024-09-25 07:44:21	+incog	a roarscharch pic is the ink blot test
2024-09-25 07:44:21	+zif	dont talk about that kind of crime unless you want to get flagged for being watching
2024-09-25 07:44:23	+zif	watched
2024-09-25 07:45:04	+fahrrad	but if you talk to the manager and say you want to join the CIA and touch your left nostril with your right pinkie, he'll get someone to interview your family and friends to ensure you're loyal to the cause
2024-09-25 07:46:04	rkorandy	fahrrad you really think they'll let a orangutang like Jigsaw
2024-09-25 07:46:11	+incog	real life isnt like action movies enometh, the cia are not hitmen, its mostly very boring intel sorting and creating humint networks

2024-09-25 07:49:19	+incog	the humint network for the IRA, when i rolled with them were the taxi drivers, they knew all the locals and who was being picked up from which airports, they could lower peoples guards with opening jokes and probing them about why they were there, people would divulge as its just a cab driver right

2024-09-25 07:52:26	+johnny	no you're not agentmx_ 
2024-09-25 07:52:30	+incog	fast food workers and short order cooks also work well as humint networks, especially if they are located near a listening post, embassy or known stakeout locations
2024-09-25 07:52:37	+johnny	you'd have to take a drug test agentmx_ 
2024-09-25 07:52:45	+agentmx_	why?

2024-09-25 07:54:28	+incog	he learnt everything he knows from CoMBo, who was already shit at trolling, so it is to be expected
2024-09-25 07:54:36	+johnny	agentmx_ if i was going to troll you, you'd know
2024-09-25 07:54:37	+zif	it's kind of fun that alcohol is potentially harmful

2024-09-25 07:55:33	+johnny	i just keep thinking back to a few weeks ago when incog proudly listed his credentials and thought "Founding member of GNAA" was some kind of accomplishment
2024-09-25 07:55:35	+johnny	lol
2024-09-25 07:55:47	+johnny	that was the point which i legit felt bad for him as a person

2024-09-25 08:10:29	+fahrrad	mrna is technically NOT a vaccine
2024-09-25 08:10:29	+johnny	this is where incog goes quiet, as his party was ruined by truth
2024-09-25 08:10:45	+zif	kamala is honestly more trustworth than trump
2024-09-25 08:10:55	+zif	trustworthy
2024-09-25 08:10:56	+fahrrad	no matter how they try to redefine what a vaccine is, I won't allow it
2024-09-25 08:10:58	+zif	trump is a flake
2024-09-25 08:11:16	+fahrrad	kamala harris is maybe trustworthy if your name is george soros
2024-09-25 08:11:19	+zif	trump is a performance artist
2024-09-25 08:11:27	+johnny	it's not, mRNA is in itself just a type of mRNA but it's responsible for cell signaling  and synthesizing new dna among other things

2024-09-25 08:11:50	+zif	i thought it was fragments of rna

2024-09-25 08:13:15	+fahrrad	I somehow don't get what the difference is between RNA and mRNA because RNA is transcribed from DNA and then exits the nucleus, gets into the ribosomes that then transcribe that into proteins
2024-09-25 08:13:51	+johnny	RNA is the broad term
2024-09-25 08:14:05	+johnny	and that transcription takes place via enzymes

2024-09-25 08:14:28	+fahrrad	molecularly they're made up of the same basepairs adenine, cytosine, thymine and uracil

2024-09-25 08:15:09	+johnny	unlike DNA that is ATCG
2024-09-25 08:15:37	+fahrrad	guanine in DNA codes to uracil in RNA
2024-09-25 08:15:39	+johnny	but the base molecules are similar minus the replacement of uracil for guanine
2024-09-25 08:15:48	+zif	if you are afraid of what they are injecting you with you should be afraid of what the chinese might put in your food or medicine
2024-09-25 08:16:03	+incog	hes afraid of everything, it comes with being a coward
2024-09-25 08:16:04	+johnny	well of course zif that's valid too

2024-09-25 08:18:20	+johnny	it's not too late to change, i believe

2024-09-25 08:20:09	+zif	are you trying to make me look stupid
2024-09-25 08:20:33	+johnny	no i'm asking what one could accomplish in a day on drugs versus months of no drugs
2024-09-25 08:20:40	+johnny	im genuinely curious
2024-09-25 08:21:02	+johnny	unless you have debilitating pain, or something like that
2024-09-25 08:21:22	+johnny	but even then, that's just a bandaid
2024-09-25 08:21:23	+fahrrad	life is pain, lady.  anyone who says otherwise is selling something.

2024-09-25 09:31:05	+zif	sometimes just because they are crazy

2024-09-25 09:35:21	+fahrrad	consider, if an intelligence from outside the earth can get here, and that if humanity has documented sightings for thousands of years, they could have destroyed our entire existence at any time
2024-09-25 09:35:38	+fahrrad	but they didn't
2024-09-25 09:35:57	+zif	oh
2024-09-25 09:36:10	+zif	i think there are probably aliens here
2024-09-25 09:36:29	+zif	i don't think i have evidence for that though
2024-09-25 09:36:35	+zif	i don't think anyone else should believe that
2024-09-25 09:37:18	+fahrrad	angels are an intelligence from outside the earth
2024-09-25 09:37:43	+zif	maybe maybe not
2024-09-25 09:38:15	+fahrrad	I mean, which is more likely, angels, or biological entities from a far off star system who arrive here via an artificial conveyance
